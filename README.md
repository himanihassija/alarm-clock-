# Python Alarm Clock

A simple command-line alarm clock built using Python. This project allows users to set an alarm for a specific duration, after which a sound is played to notify the user.

## Features
- Set an alarm using seconds
- Plays an alarm sound when time is up
- Simple and beginner-friendly logic
- Uses time tracking for accuracy

## Tech Stack
- Python
- time module
- playsound module

## How It Works
1. The user sets the alarm duration in seconds.
2. The program tracks the elapsed time using a loop.
3. Once the specified time is reached, an alarm sound is played.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-alarm-clock.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd python-alarm-clock

3. Install required dependency:
   pip install playsound

## Usage
Run the script using:
   python alarm.py

Enter the number of seconds for the alarm when prompted.

## Example
If you enter 10, the alarm will ring after 10 seconds.

## Future Improvements
- Allow setting alarm using hours and minutes
- Add a graphical user interface
- Add multiple alarms support
- Improve error handling

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding loops and time tracking
- Working with external Python libraries
- Building real-world beginner projects
